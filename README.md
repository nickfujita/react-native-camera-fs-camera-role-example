# react-native-camera-fs-camera-role-example

This is an example react native project that demos how to use the camera, cameraroll, and fs modules.

Taking pictures saves images to disk space allocated for application.

While reviewing captured images, toggle images that you would like to save to camera roll.

Upon submitting, images maked to be saved will be moved to the camera roll, and all images saved during session will be cleaned up from disk.
